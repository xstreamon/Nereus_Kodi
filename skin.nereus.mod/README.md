# skin.nereus.mod


## My mod of the Kodi 18 (Leia) version of Estuary.

This is a very light modification that provides the following:

* mixed mod from skin.estuary.leia.pkscout.mod & skin.nereus (THX to pkscout and ge2301)
* own PVR Modifications
* ability to reorder and turn off home screen left menu items
* ability to reorder and deactivate sub-menu widgets
* option to use small icons for the categories
* ability to change the action of most of the main menu items (to one of a preset group of choices based on the menu item)
* added a new TV Show widget called Unwatched/In Progress Shows (it's off by default)
* setting to change the color diffusion of background art (from 0 - 100%)
* support for Artist Slideshow on the music visualization screen (including artist bio) if Artist Slideshow is installed
* option to trigger music visualization screen when you start playing music
* option to use alternate layout for weather widget in top bar that doesn't overlap with certain views
* added categories in TV category widget for X-NEWA and Pseudolibrary if those addons are installed
* option to use an alternate timer layout that puts the show name before the channel name in the PVR listings
* ability to use Weather icon packs to change the look of the weather screen (code from Guilouz)
* option to use the Weather menu as a weather clock (really only works with a RPi 9" touchscreen, requires additional addon <https://github.com/pkscout/script.weatherstation.lite> and software <https://github.com/pkscout/rpi.weatherstation.lite>)
